# Starc Backend Setup Guide

This README provides the instructions necessary to get the backend service up and running.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. First, clone the repository and switch to the `starc-backend` directory:
   ```
   cd starc-backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the backend service:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

### Running the Tests

To run the automated tests for this system, use the following command:
```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

This will discover and run all the tests in the `tests` directory.
